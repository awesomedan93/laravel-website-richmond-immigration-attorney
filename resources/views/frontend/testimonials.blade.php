When I wanted to bring my fiancé to the states, I met with many lawyers in town to discuss the process and paperwork for the visa. Soulmaz was my favorite among them all!  I was 100% satisfied to hire her because she is very sincere, knowledgeable, and will do her best to win your case. Now, she is working on my wife’s green card as well. All in all, she is highly recommended! "
