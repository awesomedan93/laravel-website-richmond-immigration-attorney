                            Attorney Soulmaz Taghavi was featured in Chesterfield Observer stressing that there is indeed a fresh wave of fear of deportation among Chesterfield County's growing Latino population.

                            It’s a stressful time for Noemi. In addition to working full time at a Midlothian laundromat, Noemi has three children and lacks the money to send her oldest, a senior in high school, to college. Her second child suffers from mental illness and was recently diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, requiring frequent trips for medical treatment. Her youngest is, well, a toddler.But unlike most Midlothian moms, Noemi is an undocumented immigrant, living in the United States illegally since 1999.
