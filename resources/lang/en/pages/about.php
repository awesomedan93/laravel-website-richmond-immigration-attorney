    'first_paragraph' => 'The ancient Chinese proverb wishing, “may you live in interesting times” 
    has never been more true. Two of the most controversial issues facing society today are 
    immigration and criminal justice. As laws have become more complex, the average person 
    cannot afford to take on these twin hurdles without competent, aggressive legal counsel.',

    'second_paragraph' => 'Founded at the end of 2016, Novo Taghavi, Ltd. is a law firm specializing 
    in personal service for difficult criminal and immigration cases. Soulmaz Taghavi honed her skills 
    in both disciplines while Raul Novo has concentrated solely on criminal and traffic representation. 
    The unique pairing of these two Children of Revolution to take on the toughest cases clients face was 
    a natural consequence of the blending of laws known as “crimmigration.” Make an appointment today with 
    Soulmaz or Raul and see how we can help you navigate these interesting times.',
